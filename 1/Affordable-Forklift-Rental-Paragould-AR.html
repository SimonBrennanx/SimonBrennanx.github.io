From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision.
