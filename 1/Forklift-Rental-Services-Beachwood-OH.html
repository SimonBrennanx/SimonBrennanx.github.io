<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Increase warehouse and plant space by eliminating the need for stocking parts and providing space to service equipment. Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability. Here at 4 Wheel Parts, we have a huge selection of shock absorbers from the leading brands in the industry such as Pro Comp Suspension, King Shocks and Skyjacker to choose the shock absorber for your off-road vehicle or your daily driver.</p>

The big diameter and width of the tyres together with a good ground clearance give a great safety, grip and stability for driving over obstacles at full load.
