Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift.
