<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>Why not check out our selection of used forklifts or contact us for more information. Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system. For electric lift trucks and batteries, you'll want to review the battery charger requirements.</p>

Whether you want a brand new pickup truck fitted with an aftermarket lift kit, or you are looking for a pre-owned model that is already raised up, we can help you get exactly the right truck for your needs.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
