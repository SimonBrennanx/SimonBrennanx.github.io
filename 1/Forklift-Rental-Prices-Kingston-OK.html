<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models.

Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car.
