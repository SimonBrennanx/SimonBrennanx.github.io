<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment?

Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing.

If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
