Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations.

There has been talk of making DOT crash bars mandatory on all lifted vehicles, to help eliminate stock-height vehicles from continuing underneath a lifted vehicle.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
