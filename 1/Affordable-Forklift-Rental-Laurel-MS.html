<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>

Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

We have over 4,000 trucks available for hire for just one day, a week or several months.</p>

Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine.</p>
