<p>Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement. Depending on its capabilities and features, a new reach forklift might cost approximately $15,000 to $35,000 and up. We are exporter and has created a benchmark in the industry as a trusted manufacturer of hand pallet truck wheels. Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>

Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again.

A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
