Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>Workers need to be trained in proper load management before operating this forklift. Before you can spice up your life with a lifted ride, you likely are in need of some financial help.

The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops.
