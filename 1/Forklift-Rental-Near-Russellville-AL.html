<p>Industrial reach forklifts are another common forklift, primarily used in warehouses. Only trained and authorized operators shall be permitted to operate a powered industrial truck. The best place to hire a forklift throughout Melbourne, Victoria and Australia. A reach truck helps operators to put pallets away at height in narrow aisles. The controls of a forklift consist of a series of levers which open and close valves on the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
