<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

A suspension lift is a modification to a vehicle to raise the ride height It is done for the purpose of improving the off road performance of SUVs or trucks and other off-road vehicles , or for cosmetic purposes. This type of forklift cannot be used for indoor applications.</p>

<p>If you're based in California, Ahern Rentals is a great place to look into.
