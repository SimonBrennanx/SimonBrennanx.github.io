<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity. This is used, for example, when the tires on one side of the forklift are up on a mound of dirt and the tires on the other side are down in a rut.</p>

Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
