Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>Safe operation requires advanced skill and training in forklift usage, and specific protocols should be followed to ensure safety of the operator and others in the vicinity.
