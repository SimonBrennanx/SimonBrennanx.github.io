<h2>Cat Lift Truck Jordan</h2>
<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>

<h3>Drum Poly Deck With Pallet Jack Pockets Jordan MN 55352</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>We have a wide range of indoor and outdoor lift trucks. Powered pallet jacks: These jacks contain an electric motor which assists the user in lifting and moving heavier and even stacked pallets. Efficiently handle bulky, delicate and odd-sized loads with our specially equipped orderpickers - in your choice of 24 volt or 36 volt power units to match your application.</p>
