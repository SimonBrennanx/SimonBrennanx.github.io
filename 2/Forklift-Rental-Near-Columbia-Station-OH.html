<p>This safety switch (which can be a pedal or other special safety harness) will prevent the the lift truck from moving unless activated by the operator. It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>

Extreme Weather: Since rough terrain forklifts come equipped with high-traction tires, they can tackle all kinds of weather conditions. The Apex features a 6 inch off road suspension, custom wheels, and all-terrain tires.</p>
<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>

Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility.
