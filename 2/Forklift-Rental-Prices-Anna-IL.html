This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler.

These machines are replacing traditional forklifts and rough-terrain forklifts due to their increased versatility, safety and capacity; also, the ability to work better with delivery vehicles, lorries and containers.</p>
<p>And, of course, a big, lifted monster truck just looks extremely cool. For Xtreme, limiting the turning radius of the machines is a focus, and the three larger models have an outside turning radius of 13 feet 7 inches. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors.
