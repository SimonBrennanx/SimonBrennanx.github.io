<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>The Chevy Silverado lifted trucks will get you to the next level of power and overall performance. The industrial forklift is a combination of a telehandler and a warehouse forklift.
