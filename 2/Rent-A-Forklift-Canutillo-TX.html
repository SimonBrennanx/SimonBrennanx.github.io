<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

High sales of new construction lifts after 2008 are loading the used market up with competitively priced units today.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
