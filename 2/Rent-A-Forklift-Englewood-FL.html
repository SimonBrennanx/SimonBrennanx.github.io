<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

They offer straight forward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck to lift and transport loads.</p>
