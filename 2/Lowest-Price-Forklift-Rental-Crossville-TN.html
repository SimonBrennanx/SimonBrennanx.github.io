<p>Warrior Quick Lift Pallet Trucks are manufactured from heavy gauge steel, with durable tandem nylon rollers and steering wheels for easy maneuverability when under load. The counterbalanced, fuel-driven forklift is suited for outdoor use. Internal combustion (IC) forklifts are powered by a traditional engine that runs on one of several types of fuel: compressed gasses or diesel.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble.
