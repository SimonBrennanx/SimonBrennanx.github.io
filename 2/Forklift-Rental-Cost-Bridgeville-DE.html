Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time.

Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>
