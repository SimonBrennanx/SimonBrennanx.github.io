Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking.

A typical telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is long and low with a pair of wheels at the extreme front and another pair located towards the rear. Actually, this pallet jack operates simi-electronically, and it works best for transporting and lifting tasks.</p>

At Westminster Lift Truck Services, we always recommend that with the money needed for buying a new forklift, you can buy more used forklifts to improve your workforce productivity and have the budget for minor maintenance.</p>
